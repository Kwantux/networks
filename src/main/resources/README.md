# Configurations

Most settings can be changed in networks.conf

Crafting recipes can be changed in recipes.conf

## Language

To change return messages, you can edit the used language file in the networks.conf

Change the setting "lang" to any language shortcut, that is currently supported

The supported languages can be found in the /lang folder, the names of the files in there (without .yml !!) are the language key, you can use for the "lang" setting.

You can also create new languages for the plugin, by copying the en.yml and manually translating all the values.

If you just want to change one message, you can also directly edit the en.yml
