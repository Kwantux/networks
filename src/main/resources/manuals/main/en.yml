All items put into input chests will be automatically sorted into their respective sorting chests or into any misc chest, if there is no fitting sorting chest.\n\n
Sorting chests can have multiple item filters, including unstackable items.\n"

     \n
To install components (input/sorting/misc chests), first select your network, then craft these at the crafting table and apply them to any chest.\n"

  - "
If you want your component to be a double chest, just place a normal chest next to it, so they connect.\n\n"

           <bold><dark_green>[Network Wand]</dark_green></bold>\n
           \n
  You should craft a network wand to configure the filters of your sorting containers.\n\n"
  - "\n
  The network wand can also be used to view information about a component and to define container priorities (What chest should be filled up first)

           <bold><dark_green>[Range Upgrades]</dark_green></bold>\n
 \n
  An input chest can only transfer items a specific distance.\n\n
  Increase this by crafting antennas and right click them on any network component."
